# eBay_car_listing_data

## Introduction
The work that I've uploaded here forms part of the coursework for the Data Science track on Dataquest. It reinforces the topics learnt throughout the course and provides the opportunity to develop a methodology for data analysis and to begin developing a portfolio. The work and analysis are my own. You can find more information on what guided projects are here:
